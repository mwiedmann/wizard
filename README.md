# WIZARD

Wizard is a metroid-vania where you play as a wizard's apprentice trapped in your master's tower. Is it a test or has something gone wrong? Your only choice is to venture into the unknown areas of the tower.

## Engine

Wizard's engine uses a series of .json file loaded at runtime to configure the layout of the game. This will allow easier room construction and for different adventures to be created. Point it to any url with a set of .json files and your custom adventure is loaded.
